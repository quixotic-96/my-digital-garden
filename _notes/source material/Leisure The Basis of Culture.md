I.
 
As Europe begins to rebuild itself in the latter half of the 20th century, she must ask herself in what tradition will she make her home? Will she build through total work or on leisure. As moderns we take for granted that Man is made up of "workers", but this makes a specific claim on who and what Man is and we must examine this.

II. 

"Intellectual worker" implies the mode of man's knowledge. Are you looking at a rose or are you observing it? That to say, are you contemplating the rose or are you quantifying and measuring the rose? When we contemplate, we are receiving the rose and allow it to enter into us; in a way we have a relationship with what we contemplate. {something something attention is love}

Medieval philosophers made a distinction between _ratio_ and _intellectus_. _Ratio_ is the discursive, the searching and the examination. _Intellectus_ is that simple reception where "...truth offers itself like a landscape to the eye." (pg. 28) It is both the _intellectus_ and the _ratio_ together that makes up our power of knowledge.

Kant posits that all of our knowledge is discursive or the result of the active "observing mode" of knowledge: comparing, examining, relating, distinguishing, abstracting, deducing, and demonstrating. Knowledge is gotten and is never received from outside one's self. A consequence of the Kantian mode of knowledge is that for a person to know anything they must always work and only work. Knowledge can never come to us and enter into us from outside of ourselves; nothing is inspired. The intellectual worker hardens his heart in perpetual activity. Not only is he unable, he is also suspicious of the fruits of contemplation because it is not effortful or toilsome. It is the Herculean effort of hard work that becomes the evidence that something is true or good. It is the toil that justifies.  

If it is the toil that justifies philosophizing and finding the truth, then toil becomes the sign that one is getting closer to the truth. If toil is what justifies, then toil is always hand in hand with what is moral/virtuous/good. Hard work is what is good.

St. Thomas Aquinas says pretty much the opposite about the relationship of toilsomeness/hard work to goodness. He says the essence of virtue is in the good rather than the difficult. As we grow in virtues, doing what is good becomes less toilsome, less effortful. As we live the good life; become moral; become virtuous, it isn't that we fight against our natural human state and mold it (contort it, perhaps) to doing hard-work-which-is-good... rather growing virtues allows us to follow our human nature in the right way. "...the essence of knowledge does not consist in the effort for which it calls, but in grasping existing things and in unveiling reality." (pg. 34) When you're grasping existing things, your hands are at once feeling its weight and its other observable qualities and also receiving it. _Ratio_ and _intellectus_. And as highest virtue is not effortful (because we're perfected/whole in a way that the powers of our human nature flows, effortlessly, rightly-ordered) so highest knowledge is breathed into us; inspired. Blessed is the one who listens to wisdom, watching daily at her gates, waiting beside her doors. This is not to say that great knowledge is not ever preceded by effort of thought; effort is not the cause, it is a condition of great knowledge. Again, to know is to reach the reality of existing things and existing things are not circumscribed within our effort of thought.

So the intellectual worker, making effort the good itself (rather than seeking to know truth of actual real things), means the worker must suffer/toil without relation to reality. Hard work for the sake of hard work. Christian suffering, sacrifice, isn't an end unto itself, but instead is the discipline to follow the Way, the Truth, and the Life. {something something ascetism isn't about forcing your will to do grueling things}

"The inmost significance of the exaugurated value which is set upon hard work appears to be this: man seems to mistrust everything that is effortless; he can only enjoy, with a good conscience, what he has acquired with toil and trouble; he refuses to have anything as a gift." pg. 35-36 ([[You do not earn your living]]

Along with the intellectual worker making the claim that 1) knowledge comes exclusively out of discursive thought-work and 2) that the effortfulness of that discursive thought-work becomes the criterion of the gotten-knowledge's truth, there are 3) social implications of who this intellectual worker is within society. 
The intellectual worker is a functionary in society; the toil is mental rather than like the wage-earner who swings a hammer, but both menial laborers and intellectual laborers are concerned with being useful and productive. Make number go up. Measure outcomes. Think of all the things "administrations" do of various kinds... The inner meaning of "intellectual work" points to this: every activity of mankind, man's existence, must have a utilitarian function. The intellectual work takes the traditional realms of liberal arts and flattens them into the servile arts (but perhaps man being trapped into only utility also deprives him the full expression of the servile arts, also).

Liberal arts are those disciplines which are an end in themselves. The concept of the modern intellectual worker enslaves the liberal arts to meet a practical end and to be a functionary-- this, then, is not liberal arts at all and becomes something else. If we assent to the modern concept of the intellectual worker, we no longer have the liberal arts in any real sense.

"I have never bothered or asked," Goethe said to Friedrich Soret in 1830, "in what way I was useful to society as a whole; I contented myself with expressing what I recognized as good and true. That has certainly been useful in a wide circle; but that was not the aim; it was the necessary result."
