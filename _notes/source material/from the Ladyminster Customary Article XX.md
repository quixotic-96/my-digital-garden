>We do not labor for our own personal satisfaction or enrichment, but to avoid idleness, to supply our common needs, and to enable almsgiving. Undertaken in this spirit, work is consecrated as charity, and becomes a life giving partnership with God in creation, rather than drudgery or a burden. We do not own our workâ€“ much less should we allow it to own us. Rather, we perform it as an offering to God and to our brothers, for so long as the Abbot deems it appropriate for us and for the Monastery. When performed for God, and out of love for the brethren, all labor is equal in honor and importance regardless of its prestige or financial recompense.

I thought to myself during a particularly self-loathing moment, "I seem very hard to please" and maybe, hopefully, I can turn that towards something good. If I can become unconcerned with pleasing myself-- meeting my own demands and expectations ("expect nothing from anyone," maybe even myself? In a way?)-- then perhaps I can lay aside the distracted self destruction of restless _acedia_. 

If I measured my daily activity by avoiding idleness, supplying common need (not to be confused with income only), and enabling almsgiving (same again)... how might that look?
