I was watching a video by Claire Yixuan Zhang detailing the process of making a silk bias binding for both binding and decorative applique, both of which are used extensively in Chinese tailoring. 

The silk is starched with wheat paste, ironed (with pressing cloth to not cook the starch), and the fabric is marked on the bias to cut out the strips of fabric at 1.5 cm wide. When accounting for the width of the mark making and cutting, this means the strips will end up about 1.3 cm wide. The finished bias binding will be about 3 mm wide once folded and sewn in place. Three fold lines are marked along the length of the bias strip (equidistant, from the look of the video). The technique to get a very neat crisp folds for the bias binding is called da shui xian or "marking the waterline". A short length of cotton yarn is wetted in the mouth and pressed to the fold line; the amylase in saliva breaks down the starch on the fabric which will take on pressing much more easily than the surrounding still-starched fabric. After this preparatory and pressing technique is applied, it comes together as usual bias binding does (but it's very small and in silk!!)

I'm interested in applying this technique to making bias binding for embroidery/other decorative fiber arts (quilt banners and such).
