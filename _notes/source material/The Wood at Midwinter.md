I love her. I love them. I love the Hidden Sun, the Midwinter Son. 

(I had an image cross my mind as Merowdis spoke with the wood, and the wood talked about the sun in everything, of the sun in annual phase (revealed, hidden, revealing again) alongside the moon hiding and showing her face monthly. It's a good pattern.) 

I read this story right after reading [[Holy Fools]], and of course this (fictional) hagiography feels right at home with the other hagiographies. I've been in a closed-off head and and heart space lately and these are the sort of things that expand and open me up again; I want to love the wild abandon of poverty, I want the quest of virginity, I want the desire that underlies watching-listening obedience. (I think I might want to be holy.)
