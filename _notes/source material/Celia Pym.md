cool artist I read about in [[Wheesht]] and had heard about online before that. The book highlights two of her projects, _Parallel Practices_ (2014) and the repair of her uncle Roly's sweater that had previously been [[mending|mended and mended again]] by her great aunt Elizabeth. _Parallel Practices_ took place in a cadaver dissection room where Pym established a mending desk. She accepted the beloved items of staff and students in need of repair and worked at them while the students worked at their dissection tables. Mending garments is deeply personalizing-- the wear and damage a garment undergoes happens within a particular time (sudden, or over a long time), a particular place, and on a particular person. As students learn human anatomy by dissecting donated bodies, they often must distance themselves from the person they are cutting into to be able to carry on with their work.
