# I'm not here to write spark notes

Or, on the making of reading notes

When making reading notes here I don't want to only make a direct summary, after all, I should be able to pick up these books again and skim them if I need a quick summary or reminder. The reading notes should be made enough in my own voice that they can connect easily with other ideas I've written out. So reading notes are somewhat transforming the material, alloying them with what I'm thinking about at the time of reading-- the goal is not to write another spark notes that would give someone else an accurate summary of what the author is saying; what the author is saying will be colored by my current mental landscape and it won't really be worth my time to try to resist that. The goal instead, I think, probably, is to put down in writing what I'm reading in a way that show's how the author's ideas cause a sort of sympathetic resonance with the other ideas knocking about in my head.
