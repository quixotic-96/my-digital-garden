# gluttony is madness of the stomach
Gluttony
This evil thought is essentially any way that we let food dominate us. This can be relying on comfort food, keeping fancy food for the sake of impressing others, flippantly saying, "it's a feast day" and letting food rule the day. Food-anxiety is also gluttony-- worry that the food we have is making us ill and worry that the fasts of the Church makes us ill. "Gluttony is a kind of timidity, a thought which limits spiritual imagination by a nagging hypochondria."

Simple, faithful, self-denial is the cure to gluttony-- not spectacular feats of ascetism.
