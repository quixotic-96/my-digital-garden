Temptation can come from within and without. When it comes from without, they are evil thoughts/ideas perceived by our senses and our spiritual-sense (the nous) from the demons. When it comes from within it is because we have permitted sin to enter us and it stays there, it is the sin-sickness, the frailty of Adam's children. Temptation is permitted by God (God does not tempt anyone! Epistle of St. James) for us to struggle against. When we experience temptation God has not abandoned us, [[Psychomachy is the place of God's healing|God is with us.]]
