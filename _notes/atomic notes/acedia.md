Acedia, the demon of noonday, is the passion which brings on a slackness of the powers of soul, or despondency. One of the [[eight evil thoughts]] described by [[Evagrius]] it is (one of?) the "end of the line" tempations. It comes and settles in after anger or sadness. It attacks the body as well as the intellect. It manifests in many different ways and degrees, and will tell you this lie sometimes softly or reasonably and sometimes harshly or polemically, but all the manifestations have in common that they tell you to hate what you have before you (where you are, how you live, what you do) and to desire what you cannot/do not have. Thus you can be tempted to torpor, to distraction, or to restless [[Leisure The Basis of Culture|total work]].
