title: just try to make it look natural!
layout: note

Trying to figure out how organize this site is difficult; I can tell I'm scaffolding too hard from the start. The issue is that I have a lot of notes to import into this space and so the links aren't naturally occuring. They're like awkward grafts onto a bare whip sapling.

Things will continue to look weird as I figure this out!
