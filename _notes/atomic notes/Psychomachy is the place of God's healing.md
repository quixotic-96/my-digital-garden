Spiritual warfare (psychomachy) is a key-part of soul restoration; it is the mode of cooperation with God in becoming like Him/theosis/healing. "As fire tests silver and gold, so temptations test the heart of a monk." ...or any Christian. God's providence is so vast that in permitting the demons to tempt us and lay traps for us and giving us the freedom to [[What is tempation|fight and oppose them]] is the very means of growth and healing.
