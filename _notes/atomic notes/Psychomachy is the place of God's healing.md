# Psychomachy is the place of God's healing

Spiritual warfare (psychomachy) is the mode of cooperation with God in becoming like Him/theosis/healing. "As fire tests silver and gold, so temptations test the heart of a monk." ...or any Christian. God's providence is so vast that in permitting the demons to tempt us and lay traps for us and by giving us the freedom to fight and oppose them is the very means of growth and healing.
