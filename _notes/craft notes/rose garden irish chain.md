### notes:

This was my first ever quilt as well as being the first time I've _really_ used my sewing machine! I've had it for years (thanks, mom) but I've always been kinda scared of it. A big confidence boost was using my friend Rachel's sewing machine over Christmastide and the start of Epiphanytide while making a dress for myself under her watchful eye; I wouldn't have been able to make this without that little push. The quilt measures approximately 50" x 50"; as you'll see in the pictures below, the pattern is achieved by making rows of 9-patch block and plain blocks. Before this project I didn't really get how all those traditional quilt block patterns came together, but now one of my favorite things is to look at a quilt and try to puzzle out all the little components that come together in a quilt top.

There are steps I could've taken to make this quilt more neat and exact... in the future I might take the time to do those things. But on this go around, I did take time to unpick a seam or two or three and resew them! This is noteworthy because I hardly ever _ever_ stop and redo because I usually feel like this will throw off my momentum or motivation and then the magic attention tunnel will be lost and then I will never ever finish the project and I hate my unfinished project graveyard more than I hate janky finished projects. I think there is a happy medium here that I am hopefully slowly finding and in the meantime ditching my "perfectionism".

I'm interested in continuing to quilt-- especially with more traditional quilt block patterns and with reclaimed or secondhand fabrics. Naturally dying fabric or block printing might also make an appearance... A quilter I've been inspired by is Jessica Lewis Stevens at Sugarhouse Workshop; not only for her lovely quilts but also by her online presence in general as an example of documenting and sharing creative life and work (I've not looked at her instagram, but I'm sure it's also good, as far as instagrams go).

I really like my wonky big meandering stitches for the hand quilting and my little X kisses over the mitered corners... I saw someone else do them for their big stitch binding; I made them my own; and I thought of the children's bedtime prayer as I planted a stitched kiss on each corner:

> Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,<br>
> Bless the bed that I lie on.<br>
> Four corners of my bed,<br>
> Four angels round my head;<br>
> One to watch and one to pray<br>
> And two to bear my soul away.<br>

### in summary: 

* first quilt! yay!!
* I'm still interested in quilting after doing this one! woo!
* We're taking the time to acknowledge mistakes and investing time into fixing them even when it'd be easier and less-scary to be detached and all sour-grapes about it!
