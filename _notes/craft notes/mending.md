I've been mending socks and other things for friends (less frequently for myself, hmmm) and have enjoyed it immensely. I don't think it would be worthwhile to catalogue every single finished mended piece, but I might put some pictures here and describe some various methods I use to repair things.

In [[Wheesht]] I read about the artist [[Celia Pym]] who mended garments alongside medical students working with cadavers. This picture of care at the margins of life has burned itself into my mind's eye.

When I am mending a friend's garment or other item, it is a work of [[prayer is attention|attention (which is to say, it is a work of love)]]. As Pym highlighted in her own artistic practice of mending, the whole endeavor is deeply particularizing. It mends the garment, it also changes it in ways that are not entirely practical. Like skin will scar, the qualities of the fabric are not the same once they are repaired; it does not retain the same texture, drape, or color as it did when the garment was whole or new.
