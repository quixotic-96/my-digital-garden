### notes:
This is the baby quilt for little Miss. Kanary, who is due to arrive sometime early July 2025. It is also my second ever quilt! A little over a month is a good turn around time for a quilt, but this was my only project going for this time period. I think for many of the days I was able to work on it a little every day; at the start with the machine piecing I was easily putting in 3 or 4 hours into it a day (if not more some days?) and then as I got to the hand stitching part I had slowed down to an hour or two a day (most days). It is easy for me to underestimate the mental + physical faculties it takes to do hand stitching; the contrast between the machine sewing days vs. the hand sewing days highlights this well... as does when I was trying to hand stitch when sick with a fever (I would stop and space out regularly and there was a wordless mental block of visualizing and physical movement).

 I have a fondness for the handmade goods of my childhood home, even the ones I can only give a one sentence history that goes, "So-and-so made this, she was such-and-such to my mother and father." I hope one day Miss. Kanary feels the same.

### in summary:
* Quite chuffed with how this quilt turned out; so pleased and proud of it
* it is wibbly in a lot of ways, but I less value machine-level precision in handmade things and value more its structural integrity first and then all the aesthetic qualities. Neatness over machine-level precision, and neatness is a skill cultivated overtime... and, again, this is my second ever quilt.
* I really enjoyed the hand drawn/free handed quilting design on the two borders
* the prairie point seam was a liiiittle too scant at some points and I had to repair the raw edge with parachute stitch and one chaotic patch. I think the parachute stitch works better.
