> Bless them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst bless Jacob and all the patriarchs. 
> Bless them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst bless Joseph and Aseneth. 
> Bless them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst bless Moses and Zipporah. 
> Bless them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst bless Joachim and Anna. 
> Bless them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst bless Zachariah and Elizabeth. 
> Preserve them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst preserve Noah in the ark. 
> Preserve them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst preserve Jonah in the belly of the whale. 
> Preserve them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst preserve the three holy children from the fire, sending down upon them dew from heaven; and let that gladness come upon them which the blessed Helen had when she found the precious Cross. 
> Remember them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst remember Enoch, Shem, and Elijah. 
> Remember them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst remember Thy forty holy martyrs, sending down upon them crowns from heaven. 
> Remember them, O Lord our God, and the parents who have nurtured them, for the prayers of parents make firm the foundations of houses. 
> Remember, O Lord our God, Thy servants, the groomsman and the bridesmaid of the bridal pair, who have come together in this joy. 
> Remember, O Lord our God, Thy servant Jonathan, and Thy handmaid Hannah, and bless them. Grant them of the fruit of their bodies, fair children, concord of soul and body. 
> Exalt them like the cedars of Lebanon, like a luxuriant vine. Give them offspring in number like unto full ears of grain; so that, having enough of all things, they may abound in every work that is good and acceptable unto Thee. Let them see their childrenâ€™s children, like olive shoots around their table; so that, finding favor in Thy sight, they may shine like the stars of heaven, in Thee, our God.

This is a wedding gift for dear friends who married in June; I enjoyed working on it and I think it turned out well. After finishing stitching it took me an additional month and a half to muster up the wherewithal mentally and physically to frame the thing, but I got there eventually. And in all the months I've been working on this, I've only bled over it twice and got blood onto it only once! (thankfully the blood stain is on the back hidden in the fold of the lacing lol)

If the title of the design is slightly mysterious, wonder no longer... a pippin is another name for an apple. The tawny light yellow shapes with the pink knots (see the 6th picture below) are small apples that have just set; the pink is the tassel of the flower's pistil and stamen that are still present on very young fruit. One of my favorite things about plant imagery happens when fruit and flowers are brought together out-of-time. Apples set in early spring; the pale fruit is small, hopeful, waiting. Grapes become full ripe clusters at the beginning of harvest season, around the beginning of August in the Northern hemisphere. And so: a fitting juxtaposition of anticipation with the very beginning of fulfillment shown by grape vines and pippins.

Friends, I prayed much for you while I stitched and I love you both dearly. Also, I'm sorry if it ever falls out of the frame; I don't think I did a very good job, but I hope I did a good enough job... The aim was for it to be secure without compromising the ability to take it apart again if needed. Aaaanyway.

God grant you many many years!!
### in summary:
* the third kit-design I've done from Melbury hill, pretty straight forward process of stitching
* the linen twill that came with the kit was dark compared to the reference photos, so I traced the design onto lighter colored linen twill I had in my stash
* framing is hard
* yay <3

the original design called for brown to be used at the middle vein of the grape leaves; I didn't like how this looked and opted for a light green which is closer to how grape leaf veins look in real life
