### notes:

Gifted to my dear friend R. in California, who received a marriage proposal beside a pomegranate tree (she accepted it). The second kit pattern I've done and I think it turned out well! I don't remember much about the process, but there is picture and video evidence.

### in summary:

* Hooray! I did good :)
