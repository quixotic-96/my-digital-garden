### notes:

These are the first dresses I made by myself from start to finish! It took getting into an obsessive flow state to follow through, though. I still find the process of sewing a garment very mentally intense. When I got done sewing over the weekend that I completed the black dress my back ached pretty badly from hunching over the sewing machine and ironing board for hours... So I'm glad I grew in confidence with cutting and sewing, but there remains a huge amount of mental and physical "friction" around making all the little minute decisions and the physical process. 

One of the main barriers is probably my well-cultivated apathy towards my physical appearance. At the end of the day, a homemade garment should be meeting the desire behind the statement, "I wanna wear that!" and that in kind says "people will look at me and see this." Clothes cannot help but say a lot about a person and I desperately do not want to be heard. It is of course up to each person to master their eyes and receive the image of their brothers and sisters with love, gratitude, humility... but even so, there is still a lot of reckoning with being seen when making one's own clothes.

A detail I enjoyed about my process of making these dresses is that I decided to hand finish the seams inside the dress with whip stitching. Something about the detail and care taken that no one else will ever see was very pleasing to me.
### in summary:
* Great experience, will try to sew more of my own clothes again. Someday. My current three outfits will fall apart at some point and I will be forced to sew again. (The impetus for sewing these dresses is that I had a wedding to attend and didn't have clothes other than the clothes I wear everyday...)
* Need to find ways to reduce friction around starting a sewing project. Probably at first mindset shifts.
