### notes:

I've enjoyed becoming proficient in this pattern. It's a ~40"x 40" baby blanket constructed of four ~20"x 20" squares knitted in the round, center-out; the pattern repeats four times in a round. 

There comes a moment when a knitting pattern will just "click" in your mind and you realize the little ways that it just simply **works.** No more finding your place in the lace chart; you always know where you are. Greater the degree of complexity (or apparent complexity?) in the pattern yields, in turn, a greater satisfaction with the "click" moment. It's very similar to the moment you realize you've successfully memorized a good poem or worthy prose passage. 

There's a kind of journeyman, or in-between novice and mastery, phase where you've had the "click" and see the patterns and how they work, but if you're not careful when in the flow of work (or in the flow of a recitation) you'll take the next step you think the pattern calls for and find that you've instead back-tracked or jumped the gun. I think the simplest example of this is how, if you've not put things in alphabetical order that often, you have to start reciting at "A, B, C..." to verify where "P", or some other letter, should go in the order. Works well while you're going, but if you get off track you'll have to start over. Once alphabetical ordering has been mastered in your memory, you'd be able to think backwards and forwards from any point within the alphabet. That said, with this pattern, I am at what I'd describe as a journeyman's proficiency... I have tink'd my fair share of stitches even in the last blanket square. 

I am wondering how this pattern would do knitted up in a thinner cotton yarn and used to make a larger throw or bed spread. The fact that I'm not sick thinking of making a bed spread's amount of blocks with this pattern in a thin yarn really speaks to the sweet spot between complexity and ease that I can get into when working this pattern. 

Now I will mention all my errors while making this pattern. First of all, I made the first two blocks wrong in the last four rounds. Since I only discovered this once I got to the end of the second block, I decided I had to be consistently "wrong" for the last two blocks. The last four rounds of the pattern is a 1 x 1 rib with increases at the four corners of the square. Well, I forgot I was doing 4 repeats of a chart pattern, so the increases only made it to the beginning and end of each round... oops. If I had done the last two blocks per the pattern, they'd likely be slightly larger than the first two blocks. It's possible that could've been fudged in the blocking but I did not want to risk it. Also, while cleaning up ends on the first block I made, I ended up cutting right through a yarn and had to mend the area with as much duplicate-stitch as I could manage. Since this wasn't just a straight up stockinette fabric but instead a netted/lacy area it was somewhat finicky. 

Lastly, some observations on the yarn. I really enjoyed working with it; it is exceptionally soft and cuddly. However, the ply seems extremely light... and if I buy more of this for another project someday I might even run it through my spinning wheel to tighten up the ply. When knitting, you introduce a slight amount of twist into the yarn as you handle it. Depending on how you knit and which way the yarn was plied (looks like this yarn is S-plied, Z-spun), you might be slightly twisting or un-twisting the yarn. In my case, I was slightly un-twisting the yarn and sometimes it became almost wholly un-plied and therefore prone to splitting. This was at times a little annoying, but not a major flaw in my opinion. Having such a soft ply does lend it some of its squishy cuddly qualities, after all. Also, the color! Very darling.

### in summary: 
- fun-to-knit pattern in the sweet spot between interesting and relaxing
- soft yarn that I much desire to squish my face into and admire (These qualities are shared between some yarns and all babies. I endeavor to match soft-face-squishing yarn with babies; it is only proper.)
- would knit again! and might use stitch markers next time to separate pattern quadrants...
