I have been knitting since I was about seven or eight years old. [[My mom]] crocheted, but I wanted to be different. Therefore I made my mom learn how to knit from a book so she could teach me how to knit (isn't she great? lol). I eventually also picked up crochet a bit; I had a good season of calligraphy as a teen which may someday return; learned how to spin yarn when I was 17 or so and that's still going; I've now embroidered a bit and sewn and quilted a teeny amount. 

I don't feel like a real artist; I've always felt I needed to be able to draw or play music to call myself such. I have some ideas about the separation of craft and art, which more or less amount to the dichotomy being artificial, among other thoughts. And yet I'm not sure if I'm making art. Is there art in knitting socks from a pattern? [[contact|Let me know]] if you have an answer to that.
