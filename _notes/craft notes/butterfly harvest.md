### notes:

This was my first big embroidery project that I finished. I recall it was unframed for a long time before I finally got a neat round frame to mount it in.

### in summary:

* the crewel wool kit pattern that started it all
* "it all" being me really really loving how wool looks as embroidery

### pictures:

coming soon
