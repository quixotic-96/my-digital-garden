### notes:

Below is a section of the letter I gave to the recipients to accompany this baby blanket:

...
I don't think you ever have, nor ever will again, read an explanation of a mathematics proof in a letter accompanying a gift. This is about to happen. But fear not! I promise that the mathematical science here is ruled by the queen of all sciences, theology.

The patterning of diamonds and squares that make up this blanket is called Penrose tiling. There are several variations of Penrose tiling that can be made with four or two kinds of shapes; the tiling is made "Penrose" via the rules by which the shapes can fit together. The Penrose pattern could be used to tile an infinite surface, but never repeat itself. In this it is aperiodic and lacks translational symmetry. With this property you would think that the resulting pattern would appear chaotic or haphazard. But looking at it we can see that it feels ordered in some way. While you cannot move this piece of the pattern to match over another, that would be translational symmetry, this piece can be made a mirror image, or rotated, and in this way it can symmetrically repeat itself infinitely. There are other properties which continue this theme of infinite uniqueness paired with infinite ordered-fittingness, but I won't drag them all out here. It is enough to say that this pattern is both infinitely unique and singular, yet at the same time infinitely ordered and symmetrical. And that brings us to G. K. Chesterton.

In Chesterton's Orthodoxy, he dedicates a chapter to illustrate how Christianity perfectly holds to the ordered truth while at the same time perfectly holds to those odd, unique, truths.

>The real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable world, nor even that it is a reasonable one. The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite. Life is not an illogicality; yet it is a trap for logicians. It looks just a little more mathematical and regular than it is; its exactitude is obvious, but its inexactitude is hidden; its wildness lies in wait. ...It is this silent swerving from accuracy by an inch that is the uncanny element in everything. It seems a sort of secret treason in the universe. ...Everywhere in things there is this element of the quiet and incalculable.
 -Orthodoxy, Chapter VI

It is here, in this way, that I see God's grace in this pattern. If we become quiet, and still, and listen, we can see (a little bit!) how God's grace is perfectly all-of-a-piece and perfectly incalculable. For me, this mathematical proof has become an icon that draws me into that quiet place, where God dwells. And it is in simple goods, like blankets made up of cotton and linen, made with a couple of sticks, made by these hands (so alike to any other woman's hands, yet entirely my own hands!), that I see God's "familiar love" that Lady Julian speaks about. "I saw that for us he is everything that we find good and comforting. He is our clothing, wrapping us for love, embracing and enclosing us for tender love, so the he can never leave us, being himself everything that is good for us, as I understand it."

Friends, I hope that you will delight to find, again and again, both the infinite patterns and the infinite absurdities of God's grace in your lives.

### in summary:

* hoo-whee a 2020 knit!
