Right now I am... 
- tinkering with this website to get it looking how I would like and figuring out my workflow for updating it
- re-listening to LotR (the Rob Inglis recording, of course)
- taking an online lecture course on the theology of iconography from Philip Davydov
- trying to make drawing a creative habit
