Right now I am... 
- moved house just in time to go on a three week trip, wheeeee (i am tired)
- reading _London Falling_ by Paul Cornell and _Despondency_ and _The Rublev Trinity_ both by Fr. Gabriel Bunge   
- maintaining a running habit
- beginning the LIFTOFF: couch to barbell program by Casey Johnston
- STILL tinkering with this website to get it [[just try to make it look natural!|looking how I would like]] and figuring out my workflow for updating it
